# sl-generic-gun-system
A set of scripts I've been working on for some time as a generic base for various virtual guns in the virtual world of Second Life. Can be modified and adapted to emulate different types of firearms, including functionality for animations and sounds.

Features multiple methods of triggering a weapon discharge event with the given scripting tools in the game. Most SL scripters would prefer the `changed` event variant for the best balance of script performance and server strain. But other methods might include `link_message`, script resets, and simply forgoing external node scripts depending on application.

Heavily relies on features provided the third-party [Firestorm-Viewer](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) [Pre-Processor](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/fs_preprocessor), and thus otherwise won't display nor compile properly without this tool.
